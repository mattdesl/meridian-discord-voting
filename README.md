# Meridian "Community Curated" Raffle

From Sept 15 to 23, users had a chance to vote on their favourite [Meridians](https://meridian.mattdesl.com/) within the Art Blocks `#matt-deslauriers` Discord channel to influence the "Community Curated" chapter of the upcoming [Meridian book](https://vetroeditions.com/products/meridian).

As a bonus, and to celebrate the 1-year anniversary of Meridian's release on September 28th, users who voted have been placed into two separate raffles:

- Book Raffle: A chance to win a signed copy of the book (if you voted for one or more Meridians)
- NFT Raffle: A chance to win [Meridian #784](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xa7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270/163000784) (if you voted for all 14 different Meridian Styles)

The raffle winners will be announced September 28th on Twitter and the Art Blocks Discord. The winners will be decided with the _Trusted Setup Ceremony_ described below.

> ###### 🎨✨ Consider this ceremony partly an artistic performance using the blockchain, and partly a multi-party computation scheme for a cryptographically verifiable random raffle.

## Trusted Setup Ceremony

To create a fair raffle, I've decided to use a bit of cryptography and single leader election driven by Ethereum's new Proof of Stake RANDAO mechanism[^1]. In Ethereum, each new block proposed to the network includes a `PREVRANDAO` field, which is a pseudo-random 256-bit integer.[^2] This integer will be used as a seed to select the raffle winners randomly from the list of eligible us

### Technical Details

The ceremony will use two random integers:

- `BLOCK_KEY` — this is a 256-bit integer from `block.mixHash` (PREVRANDAO value) of Ethereum mainnet block `15632936`
- `ARTIST_KEY` — this is a 256-bit random integer that I generated prior to the raffle, and which I will only reveal after the ceremony

After Ethereum finalizes block `15632936` (around Wed, 28 Sep 2022 16:01:35 GMT), I will run the [raffle script](./src/raffle-select.js) to find the winning usernames for each raffle. This does the following:

1. Query the PREVRANDAO value from block `15632936` to find `BLOCK_KEY`
2. Compute `state = xor(BLOCK_KEY, ARTIST_KEY)` to get a 256-bit random state
3. Feed the first 128 bits of `state` into the seedable PRNG `sfc32`[^3]
4. Use the seeded PRNG to compute two random numbers that will select the winning user IDs in [raffle_book.csv](./output/raffle_book.csv) and [raffle_nft.csv](./output/raffle_nft.csv), respectively.

#### The Block Key

One contribution of randomness is from Ethereum's RANDAO mechanism, which is very hard to game. Somebody attempting to influence RANDAO would need to be a validator (which itself is costly) and the chance of them being selected as a block producer at a given slot is very low, unless they control a massive percentage of all staked Ether. Block producers cannot choose a specific RANDAO integer, but they can choose to opt-out of producing a block, and so they have a very limited 1 bit of biasability.

#### The Artist Key

Theoretically, it _is_ possible (albeit extremely unlikely) that a colluding group of Ethereum block producers could slightly bias the RANDAO value to their benefit in this raffle. To mitigate against this theoretical biasing, I am also keeping secret an `ARTIST_KEY`, which is a random 256-bit integer that will be XORed with the RANDAO value to produce a final state for randomness. I will only publicly reveal this `ARTIST_KEY` value after the raffle.

This means that even though a validator could potentially bias RANDAO, they would not be able to predict in which way their bias would affect the raffle output.

Because of this, the ceremony is not completely trust-minimized, as you also have to trust that I am not running many costly Ethereum validator nodes to try and influence my own raffle. :)

#### SHA-256 Commitments

To ensure that I don't change `ARTIST_KEY` and other parameters (list of users, raffle script) after the target block is finalized, I published SHA-256 commitments to this data on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mattdesl/status/1574866811987927040) and [Farcaster](farcaster://casts/0x0715896c86914e3d203028fb003f60ef8faa53640d4a1e768d0029474eeccd01/0x0715896c86914e3d203028fb003f60ef8faa53640d4a1e768d0029474eeccd01) on September 27, 2022. After I reveal the results, you can hash the data with SHA-256 to see I have not modified the inputs into the raffle program.

Details:

```sh
# blockNumber
A = 15632936

# SHA256(secretKey)
B = 189bc0e76a8ef2ab969fc9a347908727dcabab7daf932c5501eeb74403e1beb3

# SHA256(raffle_book.csv)
C = d577870690325eebc1da51d0f65bea56525fdcf55354eadafff17257839d18f4

# SHA256(raffle_nft.csv)
D = fbb28a230d18c91461863fa2818876537474f2a75bd75345d1aedf368eaa1c4f

# SHA256(raffle-select.js)
E = 5e11097b39ffe5de9386b43bc2576fb69ea0bdb6dc900a85d5156b5773efd9e8
```

#### Caveats

If there are any bugs or critical issues raised with the ceremony, I may adjust the ceremony and re-run it (or even use another method of raffle selection).

If the selected user for whatever reason cannot accept the prize (or cannot be reached in a reasonable time frame), the subsequent random value of the `sfc32()` function will be used to determine the next winner, and so on.

The architecture of this means that there is a very small chance that the same user will win both raffles.

#### Data Collection

The data and list of eligible users in the [./output](./output) folder was collected with the scripts in [./src](./src). The snapshot was taken on the following date:

#### Special Thanks

Thanks to the following people who took the time to review this scheme and provide feedback:

Note that this scheme may not be perfect and bug-free. Feel free to send feedback.

## Source Code

This repository includes a set of utilities and functions around the ceremony that may prove useful to other developers:

- [predict-block-number](./src/predict-block-number.js) — predict a block number from a future date based on Ethereum Proof of Stake's 12-second slot time
- [random-256bit](./src/random-256bit.js) — a Node function to generate a "0x" prefixed 256-bit integer hex string with a cryptographically secure PRNG
- [scrape-discord](./src/scrape-discord.js) — tools for scraping discord messages en masse
- [raffle-select](./src/raffle-select.js) — the actual raffle program

You will need to add a `.env` file in the repository with your own private (secret) configuration:

```
INFURA_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_VALUE"
DISCORD_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_KEY_VALUE"
RANDOM_VALUE="THE_ARTIST_KEY_VALUE"
```
